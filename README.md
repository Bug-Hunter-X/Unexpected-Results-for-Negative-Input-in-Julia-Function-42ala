# Unexpected Results for Negative Input in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with negative numbers and exponentiation in Julia. The function `myfunction` is intended to square the input, but it produces incorrect results for negative inputs due to the behavior of the `^` operator. 

The solution involves explicitly handling the squaring operation for negative numbers to ensure correct results.
